new for 3.2

1. Texmex can now save to BSP's. Modifying the size of the textures or the number of
   textures will disable it. So now you cab open a BSP, paste over a texture (in the 
   detail view) and save it back to disk. mapname.bak is created automatically.
2. The size of the wad & detail views is now persistant between sessions.
3. If the detail view gets lost behind the wad view, clicking the detail view icon
   or double clicking an item in the was will bring it bakc to the forefront.
4. Mip export has been fixed and should now be compatible with the Mip format
   of other Apps, such as Wally.
5. Jpg Batch export has now been fixed.
6. The folder browser (for batch exports) has been changed, and now allows the 
   creation of new folders while browsing.
