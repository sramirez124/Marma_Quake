// IMPORTANT NOTE!
// When transforming certain brushwork into ramps, it might be a good idea to round the vertices to integer numbers,
// since the compiler tools really don't like sloped brushes with floating point coordinates, that are furthermore
// triangulated. They will probably completely mess them up, resulting in holes and other unlovely errors.
// Snapping everything to grid will avoid this in some situations. Maybe not always though, didn't test it.
