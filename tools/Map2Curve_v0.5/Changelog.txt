v0.5
1. Added FGD File and 3 Entities to use in Goldsource Editors!
   - info_curve
     This acts as a source of settings for one curve object. It features
     the same commands as the so far used textfiles.
   - info_curve_export
     This only contains the export specific commands "target" and "append"
     and will always overwrite these commands from other sources.
   - info_detailgroup
     This controls individual detail object groups and will overwrite
     the global settings for those.

2. Added "Detail Objects", which are objects (solid and point entities)
   that are being cloned and aligned along generated curves.
   Add the following commands to any entity (by leaving smart edit in
   Hammer Editor):
     Key: m2c_d_group
     Value: YourGroupname
   This will create a custom detail group that can have further settings.
   Settings to control the detail groups can be used globally in
   a usual preset file (txt) or info_curve entity or by using a personal
   info_detailgroup entity, that has the same groupname.
   You can also add settings directly to any of the groups member objects
   (IMPORTANT: Add "m2c_" in front of them, e.g. "m2c_d_enable" and use
   -1 instead of 0, as Hammer will not export 0 values to map-files).
   Settings are:
     - d_enable [0,1]    to turn detail objects on and off
     - d_pos [0-1]       to control the position of a detail object
     - d_autopitch [0,1] to turn Y axis rotation on ramps on/off
     - d_autoyaw [0,1]   to turn Z axis rotation on/off
     - d_autoname [0,1]  names and targetnames of Entites will get numbered
     - d_separate [0,1]  to export detail objects as individual objects
     - d_movey_rand [0/1 min max] Move objects along y axis randomly within range.
     - d_rotz_rand [0/1 min max] Turn objects around z axis randomly within range.
     - d_pos_rand [0/1 min max] Position objects along section randomly within range.
     - d_draw [>0]	 export every x-th Detail Object of a group
     - d_skip [>0]	 skip export of every x-th Detail Object of a group
     - d_draw_rand [0,1] completely randomize the export of Detail Objects

3. Gave M2C the ability to read texture informations from real WAD files.
   You can either paste the (absolute) filepaths of your used WAD files to
   the WADList.txt in the WAD folder or you can paste copies of the actual
   WAD files in said folder. Whatever appears more convenient to you.

4. Added commands "nulltex" and "spike_height".
   - nulltex [e.g. "SOLIDHINT"] controls the texture that is being used
     on new Faces when Brushes have been triangulated.
   - spike_height [>0] controls the height of spike Brushes that occour
     when triangulating complex Brushes

5. Priority for settings is now (when superior one wasn't found):
   For Map-Files (*.map):
     (1) Map-internal info_curve entity if existing
     (2) External preset-file (*.txt) if existing
     (3) Default settings (DEFAULTS.txt) if existing
     (4) Internal defaults
   For Setting-Files (*.txt):
     (1) External preset-file (*.txt) if existing
     (2) Default settings (DEFAULTS.txt) if existing
     (3) Internal defaults

6. Made DEFAULTS.txt in root directory work as intended. The program
   will now always use these defaults on any file, when no other settings
   could be found or loaded.

7. Optimized behaviour of target, source and append.
   All of these work once per file, as before. Custom source files can only
   be specified, when using Setting-Files (*.txt), as MAP-files will always
   be their own source.

8. Changed the rotation order for "rot" and "rot_src" from ZXY to XYZ and
   the way how to submit rotation values from 90,45,135 to "90 45 135"
   (quotation marks!).

9. Added exe launch parameters, used like this: -param
   Parameters are at the moment:
   -autoclose (closes the program instantly after curve generation)

v0.4
1. Added custom file paths for input and output files.
   target - specifies a custom file path for the final object export
   source - specifies a custom file path for the source map file
   path   - specifies a custom file path for a path file, atm used for
            simple path extrusion (type 2)
   Note: File-Paths that contain spaces, have to be put in quotation
   marks -> "C:\Path\New Folder\mycustomfile.map"
2. Added command "append" (0/1). When this is active, the exported object
   will be appended to the existing target file, without deleting its
   prior content.
3. Added simple transformations, for final and source object:
   scale 	n (e.g. "scale 0.75") 		affects the final object
   scale_src 	n (e.g. "scale_src 1.25") 	affects the source object
   Note: Scale only works for all axis at the same time atm.
   rot 		x,y,z (e.g. "rot 0,45,0") 	affects the final object
   rot_src 	x,y,z (e.g. "rot 0,45,0") 	affects the source object
   move 	x,y,z (e.g. "move 0,512,256") 	affects the final object
   Note: There is no "move_src" since "offset" is doing exactely that.
4. Added bounding boxes per default. Can be deactivated by adding "bounds 0"
   to the settings. The boxes will snap to a fixed grid size of 32 atm.
5. Added commands "range_start" and "range_end" that control how much of
   the generated curve object will be exported finally.
   Both work as percentage value (0-100). For a curve with 12 sections
   and a range of 25-50 this would mean that the sections 3-6 will be
   exported.
   Note: "range_end" replaces "arc".
6. Added "transit_tri" and "transit_round" (0/1) to enable control over the
   first and last brush of a curve and their respective cut-faces.
   This can be used to use seamlessly connect different curves or other
   brushwork, without having to triangulate and or round the whole curve.
7. Added commands "gaps" and "gaplen", to create linear middle sections
   between regular curve sections with a custom length (e.g. "gaplen 512").
   These gaps can be used for even more flexibility in specific mapping
   situations.
   Note: Gaps are not affected by horizontal texture shift- and ramp-mode.
         They only feature a basic h-shift.
8. Overhaul of brush triangulation. Added complex triangulation.
   The program will always use the most efficient way of triangulation:
     - 5 or 6 sided brushes with a trapezoid or triangle profile and
       upright front/back faces, will be turned into efficient wedge-
       brushes
     - Complex brushes will be split up into individual brushes. Each
       face will be turned into as many triangular spikes as necessary.
9. Added "skipnull" command. When active ("skipnull 1") it will skip
   brushes during export, when they are made of NULL faces only.
   This can be used effectively for triangulation of complex brushes,
   by using the NULL texture on unneded faces to save file space.
10.Finally added the shift mode "per group texture", that, when using
   solid entities, will respect all brushes of that entity in terms of
   horizontal texture shift calculation.

v0.3
1. Fixed crash when triangulating a triangular brush.
2. Triangulation now default for ramp generation ("tri 1" statement not
   necessary anymore)
3. Triangulation for 5 sided brushes (Wedge Profile) now also possible.
4. Added "path" type (type 2) for arc generation. The path is being
   taken from an additional map file: mapname_path1.map, where "_path1"
   is the path of the respective arc #1, "_path2" of arc #2 and so forth.
   Map files that contain paths, can contain multiple seperated paths.
   Each one will be used by the respective arc.
5. Added "p_reverse" option for path extrusion mode. Activating it (1)
   will reverse the direction of a path.
6. Added "p_cornerfix" option for grid path extrusion mode ("type 2").
   When activated (1) it will fix overlapping meshes of "inside corners".
7. Added World-to-Face alignment conversion on map load.
8. Fixed minor texture misalignment issues.
9. Added "ramptex" setting to control texture alignment on ramps.
10.Added "p_split" setting to control whether a path object is split
   up into many smaller pieces or left in one piece on export.

v0.2a
1. Added Drag and Drop for map and txt files. When dropping map files,
   defaults.txt will always be used for settings if it exists. Otherwise
   internal defaults will be used.
2. Added Solid Entity Support. Point Entities are still being ignored
   at the moment, but might be considered in a future update.
3. Added Custom Height command "height", which is being added to each section.
4. Added round coordinates command "round" (0/1).
5. Added "ramp" as an addition to "height". Usable with linear (1) and
   smooth (2) slope.
6. Added Triangulation "tri" (0/1) for 6 sided Brushes only (Cuboids).
   Neccessary for ramp generation.
7. Fixed settings file issue.
8. Fixed invalid Brush issue.

2019-03-15
v0.11a
1. Fixed WAD detection and file-paths issues.
2. Drag&Drop works for map files now, too. Settings are then being
   taken from defaults.txt in Map2Curve root folder, if available.
3. Added CreateWAD.exe, which will create a text file "wad_custom.txt"
   from a folder of BMP files. See its README for further information.
